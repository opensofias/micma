# micma
new abstract algebra playground. somewhat incomplete and so far with no ui whatsoever.

successor of my magmas.js project. https://github.com/opensofias/magmas.js

check out examples.js for what it can do.

## implemented features

1. define operations
2. evaluate terms
3. match algebraic expressions using equalities and quantors

## todo

1. implement and use "fromString" whenever convevnient
2. clean up examples file, for easy mix-and-match testing by console
3. make terms and queries more independent of "micmas", parameterize

## roadmap

1. generate operators with given properties
2. relations: defining properties by more than equalities
3. discover possible properties by itself (?)
4. find implications between properties (??)
5. optimization
