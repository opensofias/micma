# micma

abstract algebra playground. somewhat incomplete and so far with no ui whatsoever.

check out examples.js for what it can do.

## implemented features

* define operations
* evaluate terms
* match algebraic expressions using equalities and quantors

## todo

1. clean up examples file, for easy mix-and-match testing by console
2. make terms and queries more independent of "micmas", parameterize
4. make the whole thing more functional, i guess

## roadmap

1. generate operators with given properties
2. relations: defining properties by more than equalities
3. discover possible properties by itself (?)
4. find implications between properties (??)
5. code reduction, cutting all this 4 days old cruft
6. optimization

## history

this is a successor of the magmas.js project. https://github.com/opensofias/magmas.js

the reason for the fork was a focus on lookup-tables. i suspected this to have a bigger impact then it had so far.
